# Vietnamese Interpreter Project Guideline

## Overview
This project aims to build a near-real-time AI interpreter for Vietnamese and English using the OpenAI Whisper model on Hugging Face. It will help with communication barriers for expats and Thai colleagues during large events, providing cost-effective audio-to-text and translation solutions.


## Technical Components

### POC Phase

#### Translation and Transcription Implementation
- Translation model: gemini-2.0-flash 
- Use Whisper's built-in language detection for transcription (avoid additional complexity)
- Implement simple bidirectional translation with user choosing their main speaking language
- Basic logging for translation quality assessment

#### System Architecture
- Simple linear workflow: audio file → Whisper transcription → translation → output
- Synchronous processing for easy debugging and validation
- File-based input/output for testing each component independently
- Basic error handling and step-by-step logging

#### Logging Requirements
- Output all logs to .txt files with GMT+7 timezone timestamps
- Log format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS GMT+7] [LEVEL] message`
- Separate log files for: transcription, translation, and system events
- Include processing time, model confidence scores, and error details

### Post-POC Phase

#### Real-time Audio Processing
- Implement microphone input capture
- Create audio buffering system for continuous streaming

#### System Optimization
- Advanced async processing and parallel operations
- Result queuing system for real-time performance
- Translation caching and optimization
- Modular architecture for scalability

```

#### Environment Setup
- Python environment setup
- GPU detection and fallback to CPU

#### Testing & Validation
- Sample audio files for testing (Vietnamese and English)
- Basic performance benchmarking scripts
- Manual validation workflows using Colab Notebook

### Post-POC Phase

#### Advanced Project Structure
- Modular package architecture with proper imports
- Docker containerization
- API service implementaion (FastApi, Flask)
- CI/CD pipeline setup

#### Production Environment
- Secure environment variable management
- Database integration for logging and caching
- Load balancing and scaling considerations
- Monitoring and alerting systems

#### Automated Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with CI integration
- End-to-end testing automation
- Model performance dashboard

## User Experience Elements

### POC Phase

#### Input/Output Handling
- Command-line interface for file processing
- Support for basic audio formats (WAV, MP3)
- Simple text output to console and files

#### Translation Flow
- Manual language selection override
- Simple bidirectional translation commands
- Text-based output formatting

### Post-POC Phase

#### Advanced Interface
- Graphical user interface development
- Real-time audio processing (still dont know what recording devices are used)
- Interactive translation controls
- User preference management

#### Enhanced Audio Support
- Multiple audio format compatibility
- Automatic audio format detection
- Real-time audio quality monitoring

#### User-Friendly Features
- Automatic language detection and switching
- Translation history and bookmarking
- Accessibility features and internationalization

## System Cost

#### Development Costs
- **Setup Time**: 2-4 hours for initial environment and API configuration
- **Hardware**: Optional GPU (recommended for faster Whisper processing)

#### Operational Costs
- **Gemini API**: combine price of input and output is ~$1 per 1M tokens (Flash 2.0 pricing)
- **Hugging Face**: Free for Whisper model usage
- **Infrastructure**: Local development machine or basic cloud instance

## System Criteria
- Word Error Rate (WER) for transcription: < 10%
- End-to-end processing time: < 3 seconds
- Semantic translation score (BERTScore/COMET/BLEURT): > 0.4

# Vietnamese Interpreter Project Guideline

## Overview
This project is a real-time AI interpreter for Vietnamese and English using Google Gemini Flash 2.0 for translation and transcription. It helps with communication barriers for expats and Thai colleagues during large events, providing cost-effective real-time interpretation solutions.

## Technical Components

### POC Phase

#### Translation and Transcription Implementation
- Translation model: gemini-2.0-flash 
- Use Google Speech Recognition for real-time transcription
- Implement simple bidirectional translation with user choosing their main speaking language
- Basic logging for translation quality assessment

#### System Architecture
- Real-time workflow: microphone input → speech recognition → translation → audio output
- Synchronous processing for easy debugging and validation
- Real-time input/output with conversation logging
- Basic error handling and step-by-step logging

#### Logging Requirements
- Output all logs to .txt files with GMT+7 timezone timestamps
- Log format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS GMT+7] [LEVEL] message`
- Separate log files for: transcription, translation, and system events
- Include processing time, model confidence scores, and error details

### POC Phase

#### Real-time Audio Processing
- Implement microphone input capture
- Create audio buffering system for continuous streaming

#### System Optimization
- Advanced async processing and parallel operations
- Result queuing system for real-time performance
- Translation caching and optimization
- Modular architecture for scalability

## User Experience Elements

### POC Phase

#### Input/Output Handling
- Command-line interface for real-time processing
- Microphone input with keyboard controls
- Audio output via text-to-speech and console logging

#### Translation Flow
- Manual language selection override
- Simple bidirectional translation commands
- Text-based output formatting

### Post-POC Phase

#### Advanced Interface
- Graphical user interface development
- Enhanced real-time audio processing
- Interactive translation controls
- User preference management

#### Enhanced Audio Support
- Multiple audio format compatibility
- Automatic audio format detection
- Real-time audio quality monitoring

#### User-Friendly Features
- Automatic language detection and switching
- Translation history and bookmarking
- Accessibility features and internationalization

## System Cost

#### Development Costs
- **Setup Time**: 1-2 hours for initial environment and API configuration
- **Hardware**: Microphone and audio drivers required

#### Operational Costs
- **Gemini API**: combine price of input and output is ~$1 per 1M tokens (Flash 2.0 pricing)
- **Google Speech Recognition**: Free for basic usage
- **Infrastructure**: Local development machine or basic cloud instance

## System Criteria
- Word Error Rate (WER) for transcription: < 10%
- End-to-end processing time: < 3 seconds
- Semantic translation score (BERTScore/COMET/BLEURT): > 0.4
